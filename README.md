## Examples of Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is meant to be a tool to help me ensure I fully grasp these concepts, I made it public because it might help others too, and I may want to look over it again someday. It's glorified homework.

Throughout this repo I try to keep my code very pythonic, especially paying attention to PEP8 formatting and modern python best practices. I start off very basic and slowly ramp up the difficulty, commenting everything then only commenting new ideas/syntax.

### Contributing
If there's anything you do not understand, file an issue and I will attempt to clarify. If you think you can make my code better, by all means submit a pull request. Try to pay attentions to the ramp up in code complexity I am attempting, don't try to make some code golf nonsense in the basic data structures and expect to get merged.
